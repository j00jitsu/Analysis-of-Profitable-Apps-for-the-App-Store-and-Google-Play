    "# Analysis of Profitable Apps for the App Store and Google Play\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2018, there were about 2 million iOS apps available in the App Store, and about 2.1 million Android apps in the Google Play store. This app analysis is intended to find the most profitable types of apps to develop in terms of ad revenue, as the apps themselves will be free to download. Naturally, this means that we must find the kind of apps which are most installed, since more users means more people seeing and potentially engaging with the ads. Therefore, the goal is to help our hypothetical developers understand what kinds of apps are most likely to attract the most users on both Android and iOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will accomplish these goals with a few fairly straightforward steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open data for the App Store and Google Play apps, and create lists to more easily process the data\n",
    "2. Clean the data by removing any incorrect, duplicate, or irrelevant apps (non-free, non-English, incorrect data)\n",
    "3. Categorize and sort the apps so we can make informed statements about which ones users prefer"
